# API workflow

Production base: `https://kniferevive.com/wp-json/kniferevive-agent/v1`.
Use the merchant's `/openapi` endpoint for the exact released JSON contract.
Only capabilities returned by the deployed service are actionable.

All-category goods contracts in adapter 0.6.0: `GET /listing-categories` and
`GET /listings?scope=goods` with advertised `sku`, `model`, `mpn`, `gtin`, `brand`,
category, seller and stock filters. Check `identifier_search_ready` and deployed
OpenAPI; do not call proposed routes against older adapters. `GET /listings/{id}`
also supports `scope=goods`. See [Product discovery](product-discovery.md).
Goods selections send `scope=goods` to `/listing-checkouts`. Legacy consumers
may omit scope and retain their documented service access.

For unpaid or optionally prepaid sharpening bookings, use the separate
`booking.enabled` capability and [booking workflow](booking.md). It does not
require legacy `/quotes` or `sharpening.direct_checkout`; a disabled legacy
service workflow must not hide an enabled unpaid booking request option.

1. `GET /capabilities`, `GET /catalog?category=technology|sharpening`, and
   `GET /service-area?postal_code=94110` require no login or secrets. Availability
   is `GET /availability?postal_code=94110`, optionally filtered by `kind`.
2. Legacy technology results use `existing_woocommerce_checkout`. Marketplace
   discovery uses `/listings` across published categories, and native buyer
   handoff when enabled. See [listing checkout](listing-checkout.md) for its six
   separate routes. No marketplace provider sessions are created by the adapter.
3. To quote supported services, create a private guest session with
   `POST /sessions`, JSON `{}`, and a unique `Idempotency-Key` of 12–128 letters,
   digits, colons, underscores, or hyphens. Retain its returned session token
   privately. Its lifetime is two hours; a fresh session cannot access old orders.
4. Use `X-Krev-Agent-Session` and `Idempotency-Key` for `POST /quotes`.
   Required fields: `items` (product_id/quantity), `postal_code`, `intake`, `return`,
   `rail`, and `booking_mode`. Service products are simple operator-owned products.
   The merchant returns a hash, expiry, totals, and private review URL.
5. Open that private review URL for the customer. The fragment transfers the
   capability to a first-party HttpOnly cookie. Missing customer information is
   collected there, recalculated, and reviewed as a new quote. The customer then
   approves and creates payment details. Do not automate the approval click.
6. Alternatively, after the customer approves the final quote, retrieve
   `GET /quotes/{id}` to obtain its `consent_id`. `POST /checkout-attempts` takes
   only `quote_id`, `quote_hash`, `consent_id` and an idempotency key. Reuse the
   same request/key on network failure. A quote cannot create two attempts.
7. Retrieve `/checkout-attempts/{id}` or `/orders/{id}` with the session header.
   Numeric WooCommerce order IDs are not API authorization. Request cancellation
   or rescheduling via `/orders/{id}/change-requests`, with `action`, `reason`,
   and an idempotency key. The result is a merchant-review request, not a refund.

Do not forward the token to other hosts or put it in API query strings. Private
responses use no-store. Public catalog freshness is 30 seconds and quote expiry
is ten minutes. A final quote may change after address-based tax calculation.
Never treat an unknown shipping charge as free.

Handle `UNCONFIGURED`, `OUT_OF_AREA`, `ADDRESS_REVIEW_REQUIRED`,
`ASSESSMENT_REQUIRED`, and disabled rails with an honest site handoff.
`QUOTE_CHANGED`/`QUOTE_EXPIRED` require a new quote and matching consent.
`BUSY` permits retrying the same operation. For HTTP 429 wait 60 seconds.
`PAYMENT_UNRESOLVED` requires checking the original equivalent purchase; another
quote, payment method or shopper session must not be used to bypass it.
`unknown` or `review_required` payment state requires original-attempt status
checking or merchant assistance, not a fresh charge.

Booking-specific routes accept the private `X-Krev-Booking` capability returned
with a draft, independently of the general two-hour shopper token. See
[Booking requests](booking.md) for its narrow scope and expiry.

## HTTP client compatibility

Send `Accept: application/json`. When the host's existing HTTP tool offers a
protocol setting, prefer HTTP/2 for this API. If it supports an identifying
User-Agent, identify this client honestly as `KnifeRevive-Concierge/0.6.0`.
Credentials, browser cookies and WordPress login are unnecessary for discovery.

On October 9, 2026, PowerShell 7's default HTTP/1.1 request received a hosting
403 browser challenge; the same URL and headers using HTTP/2 returned HTTP 200
JSON. Node fetch, Python urllib and curl also successfully read the anonymous
booking-options API. This is a tested client compatibility setting, not a
guarantee for every bot host. Do not assume one client's 403 means the service,
prepayment or any menu choice is disabled.

Accept prices only after a successful JSON response with the expected fields.
Read all five `handoff_options` in returned order, their numeric
`transport_fee_minor` values, and live `services[].unit_price_minor`. Preserve
the numeric trip fee in every customer label. Report the actual response status
if access fails; distinguish a hosting HTML challenge from a JSON API error.
Do not solve challenges, spoof a browser, transfer browser cookies, use alternate
origins, or install another HTTP client during a shopping task. If the configured
host tool still receives a challenge, use the human booking page and explain
that live API access from this bot needs merchant/hosting review.
